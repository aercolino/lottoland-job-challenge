# job-challenge


## Task

Create a page displaying the current EuroJackpot draw information similar to https://www.lottoland.com/en/eurojackpot/results-winning-numbers

Load the data from https://media.lottoland.com/api/drawings/euroJackpot via AJAX.

The site should work on all WebKit-based devices. Feel free to use native JavaScript or the frameworks of your choice.

Please use ES6 and transpile to ES5 with a task runner like Gulp, Grunt, or just NPM scripts.

Use GIT as version control system and commit preferably in small steps.
